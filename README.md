PLACEHOLDER!!

Currently, this is in a rather non-working state and will probably be that way for a while. Definitely don't try to use this as is, about the best you'll be able to do is query a few of the API endpoints and get some rather poorly designed and implemented objects back.

No, I do not have any sort of roadmap or timelines for any functionality. It'll get done if and when I jump back on this project (which I also don't have a timeline for).
